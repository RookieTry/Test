A script to set up WAF using the OWASP CRS on nginx. Tested on Ubuntu.
Normally, you would only need the Modsecurity, Nginx-Modsecurity Connector and the OWASP CRS. So, you can skip the Nginx installation script.

Assumptions:
Your nginx is based in /etc/
Your deployment works.
You should know how to replace the necessary configurations such as the IP, the proxy, etc. Otherwise, you don't really have a website already...
